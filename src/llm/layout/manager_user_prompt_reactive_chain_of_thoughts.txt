pick up all ingredients needed into pots, then cook the soup, then pick up dish, then use the picked dish to pick up soup after the soup is ready, then serve the dish to the counters
remember that you should put the correct ingredients exactly following the recipe book.

Your final step will be:  analyze the current assigned subtasks from you(agent) and human potential subtasks, analyze if you need to execute reactive behaviors, such as potential collision, and better collabration using empty counter.
Return the final data with human intention , and reactive rules, you can refer to the analysis you generate in last steps.
