Analyze the environment layout and the current generated graph, analyze if there existing alternative path between each subtask node, the two agent can collaborate to finish together, that will reduce the cost, e.g. the agent could put ingredient or dishes into a certain empty couter, and another agent can pick up it from here
Or if there will be tricks/preferences when assigning subtasks, like alwasy assign a certain group of subtasks into a certain agent will reduce the overall cost. 
Return the suggestion into two variables, coordinator_suggestion for the first type, and preference_suggestion for the second type.
