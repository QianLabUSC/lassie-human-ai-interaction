Robot current state
    {robot_state}

=====================

Human current state:
    {human_state}

To finish the recipe, two agent (robot and human) are following a subtask graph, below are subtasks that are ready to execute for robot and human:
{graph_state}

Notes: that robot or human can not do pick up task if there are item in their hand, vice versa, they can not do put xxx tasks if there is nothing in their hand. 

***Your goal: 
one of human or robots are not executing a task, you now want to reassign the subtask id for both human and robots, note that human and robot can not do the same task together.
If there is an emergency task, you should assign this first. 
The adjecent subtask type, getting and putting must be assigned to the same agent. 
Remember, you should prioritize assigning task to robot even if human are executing a task. Also return a very short message to instruct human task.
