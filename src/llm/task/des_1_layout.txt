There is a robot need to collaborate with a human to finish an overcook game.
robot and collabrator interact within a grid world, specified as following
=====================
grid represents each cell of the game area with specific symbols for different elements. where " " is empty hallway that one can stand, "X" is a counter, "P" is a pot, "D" is dish dispenser, "S" is deliver location, "O" is an onion dispenser, 1 is the collaborator, 2 is the robot(you)
the position coordinates are specified by a 2D matrix where the top left corner is (0,0). and the bottom right corner is (width,hight). keep a list of all the objects/agent positions your mind. the following is the 2D kitchen layout:
['XTXXXXSX', 'X   2  X', 'X PX X X', 'X   X XX', 'T  1  DX', 'XXXXXXXX']
=====================
There is a possible order list(start_all_orders), and each order has it own recipe. for example, {"ingredients" : ["onion", "onion", "onion"]} represent a 3 onion soup.  
the possible orders for this game are:
[{'ingredients': ['tomato', 'tomato', 'tomato']}]


the required steps to make orders are: 
=====================
PickupIngredient->PutIngredientInPot->Cook->PickupDish->PickupSoupWithDish->DeliverSoup
for example:
1 Onion soup: Pickuponion->PutOniontopot->Cook->Pickupdish->Pickupsoupwithdish->DeliverSoup
2 Onion soup: Pickuponion->PutOniontopot->Pickuponion->PutOniontopot->Cook->Pickupdish->Pickupsoupwithdish->DeliverSoup
1 Tomato soup: PickupTomato->PutTomatotopot->Cook->Pickupdish->Pickupsoupwithdish->DeliverSoup
Onion&Tomato soup: PickupOnion->PutOniontopot->PickupTomato->PutTomatotopot->Cook->Pickupdish->Pickupsoupwithdish->DeliverSoup
=====================

The objects that could be held by the agent include: onion, tomato, dish, soup
