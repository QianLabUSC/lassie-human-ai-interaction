To finish the recipe, two agent (robot and human) are following a subtask graph, below are subtasks that are ready to execute:
id: 1; description: 'Put onion in pot-1'; type: 'putting'; status: 'ready_to_execute'; target_position: [[2 2]]; Distance to the robot: [3]; Distance to the human: [4]; parent subtask(s) = [0]; 
id: 2; description: 'Get onion-2'; type: 'getting'; status: 'ready_to_execute'; target_position: [[2 4]
 [3 4]]; Distance to the robot: [3, 1]; Distance to the human: [8, 8]; no prerequiste tasks. 
id: 4; description: 'Get onion-4'; type: 'getting'; status: 'ready_to_execute'; target_position: [[2 4]
 [3 4]]; Distance to the robot: [3, 1]; Distance to the human: [8, 8]; no prerequiste tasks. 
The human is not executing any subtask.
The robot is not executing any subtask.


***Your goal: 
human or robots are not executing a task, you now want to assign the subtask id for both human and robots.
