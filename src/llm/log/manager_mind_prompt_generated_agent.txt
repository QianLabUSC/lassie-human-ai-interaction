***Context: You are a chef that work for another human chef in a kitchen. You have an unlimited supply of ingredients in your kitchen. You have a recipe book that contains a list of soups that can be made with certain ingredients. To make a soup, you must first put the correct ingredients from the recipe for the soup in a pot. Once the correct ingredients for a recipe are in the pot, start cooking the pot to make the soup. The soup will take a certain amount of time to cook. Once the soup is 100% finished cooking, you can pick up a dish to pick up the soup with a dish and deliver it to the delivery location. Your goal is to work with the other chef to deliver as many soups as possible in the time frame given. For every finished soup you deliver that is from the recipe book, you get a $500 tip. You are sharing the kitchen and ingredients with the other chef.***
